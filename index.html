    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Aarav Porwal!</p>
    <p>I'm someone who loves exploring new ideas and connecting with people. Public speaking is something I genuinely enjoy, as it allows me to share my thoughts and engage with others effectively. I've always been keen on general knowledge, driven by my curiosity about the world and how things work.</p>
    <p>I'm really into web development and love learning about how to create cool and functional websites. Meeting new people is something I find excitingâ€”it's always inspiring to hear different perspectives and stories.</p>
    <p>I believe there's always something new to learn, and I'm constantly looking for ways to grow and improve myself. Whether it's coding, trying out a new skill, or just discovering something random, I'm all in!</p>
